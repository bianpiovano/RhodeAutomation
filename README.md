## ✨ Description ✨ ##
These are a pair of automated test cases using Playwright with JavaScript. 
Testing the e-commerce site of the Rhode brand.

 🔊 **Requirements** 🔊
- Node.JS, server environment

[Download it](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Playwright Automation Tool

[Install it](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)
- Browser Drivers (for Chrome, Firefox and Safari)

[Learn more](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#install-browsers)

 💭 **How to execute?** 💭 
- Clone this project in a personal folder
- Navigate to this folder trought your bash console
- Execute the next line in your terminal: 
```console
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium --workers=1
```
- I use the "headed" command to see what's happening with the browsers while executing.
- The "project-chromium" command runs the tests only in the Chrome browser (It can help to reduce the executing time).
- "workers=1" runs one test at a time (Helpful to avoid consuming too much RAM).
- I will add this to the config file next time 😜

 💫 **Preview** 👀

Executed it multiple time on my personal computer 💻:

- OS: Windows 11 
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with Radeon Vega Graphics 3.70 GHz
- Installed RAM: 32.0 GB
